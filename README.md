# Origins: A Zimbabwe Perspective on Human Potential

A single-page web presentation exploring education, capability, and human potential from a Zimbabwe perspective.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

This project uses a dual-deployment approach:

### Primary: Astro + Cloudflare Worker
- **Source**: `/astro-worker/` directory contains the Astro project
- **Build**: Static site generated with optimized loading and performance
- **Deploy**: Cloudflare Worker serves the content with enhanced caching and CDN
- **Features**: Loading screen, optimized images, performance monitoring

### Fallback: GitHub Pages
- **Source**: Root directory files for direct GitHub Pages deployment
- **Purpose**: Backup deployment method and compatibility

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### `/astro-worker/` - Modern Stack
- **Astro 5.x**: Static site generator with optimized output
- **Loading Screen**: "Origins with a Perspective on Learning" 
- **Optimized JavaScript**: Consolidated intersection observers and popup functions
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, error handling, observer cleanup
- **Worker**: Cloudflare Worker handles routing and asset serving

### Root Files - Legacy/Fallback
- `index.html`: Standalone version for direct deployment
- `visual_learning_reflection.html`: Original backup file
- Cloudflare Pages configuration files (`_headers`, `_redirects`)

## üîß Development

```bash
cd astro-worker
npm install
npm run dev       # Development server
npm run build     # Build for production
```

## üì¶ Deployment

### Automatic (Recommended)
Push to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions:
1. Builds Astro project
2. Deploys to Cloudflare Worker
3. Falls back to GitHub Pages

### Manual Cloudflare Worker
```bash
cd astro-worker
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```
