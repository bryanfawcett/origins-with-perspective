A single-page web presentation exploring education, capability, and human potential from a Zimbabwe perspective.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

This project uses **GitHub Actions for automated Cloudflare Workers deployment**.

### Architecture: Astro + Cloudflare Worker
- **Source**: `/astro-worker/` directory contains the Astro project
